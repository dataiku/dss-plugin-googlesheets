# Google Sheets plugin

This plugin provides read and write interactions with [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/sheets/about/) documents, that are commonly named spreadsheets.

It contains:

* a dataset component:
    - to read a sheet as a dataset in Dataiku DSS
    - to write a dataset into a sheet
* a recipe component: to append rows (from a dataset) to a sheet

## How to set-up

* Install the plugin in Dataiku DSS. The plugin requires the installation of a code env.
* Create a `Service Account` in the Google API Console with the `Sheets API` enabled. Export the credentials as a `JSON` token file.
* Create a new dataset or new recipe with this plugin.

## Some tips

* When using the dataset component, it is important to click on the button `Test & Get schema` to set-up the schema.
* A dataset created with the plugin can be placed as the output of a recipe. In this case, the plugin will write data to the spreadsheet when the recipe is run ("write mode").
* The plugin exposes two modes used by Google Sheets to interpret values format: [RAW and USER_ENTERED](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/ValueInputOption)

## How to get the Service Account token

The plugin uses the protocol [OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount) to connect to the Google Sheets API.

In order to use the plugin, you will need Service Account's credentials exported in a JSON token file with the Sheets API enabled. To generate this JSON, you can follow [the instructions on the plugin page](https://www.dataiku.com/product/plugins/googlesheets/).

Don't forget share the spreadsheet with the email of the service account (likely in a similar form of `...@developer.gserviceaccount.com`).
